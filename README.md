## Installation

There are three options:

First option is to open the Enonic XP Application Admin Tool. In here select "Install" and find this app in the Market list of available apps.

Second alternative is to simply download the app [JAR file](http://repo.enonic.com/public/com/enonic/app/googlemaps/1.0.0/googlemaps-1.0.0.jar) and move it to the XP installation's `$XP_HOME/deploy` folder.

Or you can build this app with gradle. First, download the zip file of this repo. Unpack it locally. In the terminal, from the root of the project, type `./gradlew build`. On Windows, just type `gradlew build`. Next, move the JAR file from `build/libs` to your `$XP_HOME/deploy` directory. The SEO Meta Fields app will now be available to add to your websites through the Content Manager admin tool in Enonic XP.

If you are upgrading to a newer version of this app, make sure to remove the old version's JAR file from the `$XP_HOME/deploy` directory.
